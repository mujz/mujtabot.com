Are you eager to join a vibrant community of lifelong learners? Every week, we come
together to transform knowledge into powerful insights, expanding our horizons and
fostering a culture of continuous discovery.
{{</callout>}}

## Why?

Have you ever listened to a podcast full of golden lessons, then filled with
excitement, you go telling your friend about it, and as you start talking, you
discover that (1) there are so many gaps in your understanding that you struggle to
explain it coherently, and (2) your friend had also listened to the same podcast and
picked out valuable insights you had missed? We've all been there.

**This club provides an environment where we digest and absorb what we learn, so we
can apply it in our lives.**

![Bloom's Taxonomy](blooms-taxonomy.jpg)

According to Bloom's Taxonomy, which is a classification of the levels of learning
meant to help educators design better learning experiences, remembering is the lowest
order of learning. At best, this is what we get when we consume content without
discussing or applying it. In this club, we will tap into the higher orders of
thinking skills, making the information we receive much more applicable, and
ultimately enriching our lives.

## What does it look like?

Every week:

1. We each 🎧 listen/📺 watch/📄 read the learning material of the week individually.
1. Then we all get into a meeting and discuss what we learned.

## Who's joining this club?

By joining, you'll be surrounded by people passionate about continually enriching
their lives through education, and appreciate the value of doing it with others.

Here are some of the core values the members live by:

This episode realigns our thinking to what's important. Psychologist Nordgren
suggests reducing friction, which is invisible, over adding more fuel when facing
obstacles.

This is one of those videos you watch once, then think about forever. It goes
beyond Gladwell's famous 10,000-hour rule and explores other requirements for
becoming an expert.

These are the topics we’ll dive into in the first month, then we’ll choose the topics
after that together.

## Our weekly calls will start on …

🗓️ **Wednesday, Jan 17**

🧑‍💻 on Zoom or Google Meet

We’ll have weekly calls thereafter.

## Membership

It is our goal to make this club as accessible as possible while also covering expenses. So we have made the following “small, medium and large” weekly price tiers available:

* 🛹 S: $8 if it’s a stretch for you to be investing in this club at the moment, please choose this tier.
* 🚲 M: $12 if you are financially stable and don’t have to think too much about whether you can afford this club, please choose this tier.
* 🏎️ L: $20 if you are financially flourishing, you have the opportunity to contribute to our scholarship fund and enable people with fewer resources to also participate.

**Scholarships** are available for those who need them. Your participation matters most to us, not the price.

## Financial Transparency

Income from membership sales will be used to cover online tools and subscription expenses. The organizing team is donating their time, so we’ll also use membership income to cover their expenses. Any surplus that is left at the end of the month will go towards The Journey (الرحلة) fund, building a pool of funds to develop the network and organize future activities like this one, the 29 day challenge, the gap year, etc.
