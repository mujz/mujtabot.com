Are you eager to join a vibrant community of lifelong learners? Every week, we come
together to transform knowledge into powerful insights, expanding our horizons and
fostering a culture of continuous discovery.
{{</callout>}}

## Why?

Here's what motivated us to kick off this club:

* In a world with so much to do all the time, we sometimes defer learning to let
  distractions rob our time.
* When we do have the time to learn, we struggle to choose what to give our attention
  to.
* The lessons we learn remain elusive, escaping our memory as time passes.
* We like hanging out in meaningful forums, but they're too hard to find these days.

**By joining this club, we get to learn together from a curated list of juicy 🎧
podcasts, 📺 videos, and 📄 articles, and we support each other in making these
invaluable lessons applicable to our own lives.**

![Bloom's Taxonomy](blooms-taxonomy.jpg)

According to Bloom's Taxonomy, which is a classification of the levels of learning
meant to help educators design better learning experiences, remembering is the lowest
order of learning. At best, this is what we get when we consume content without
discussing or applying it. In this club, we will tap into the higher orders of
thinking skills, allowing the lessons we receive to enrich our lives.

## What does it look like?

Every week:

1. We each 🎧 listen/📺 watch/📄 read the learning material of the week individually.
1. Then we all get into a meeting and discuss what we learned.

In order to absorb more from the learning material as we take it in, we'll learn what
we can do to increase our attention and memory, through practices such as non-linear
note-taking.

Additionally, during our discussions we will craft ways to incorporate and apply the
learned insights into our lives, and come back to them again in future discussions to
reflect on them and analyze our experience.

## Who's joining this club?

By joining, you'll be surrounded by people passionate about learning in a community.

Here are some of the core values the members live by:

This episode realigns our thinking to what's important. Psychologist Nordgren
suggests reducing friction, which is invisible, over adding more fuel when facing
obstacles.

This is one of those videos you watch once, then think about forever. It goes
beyond Gladwell's famous 10,000-hour rule and explores other requirements for
becoming an expert.

These are the topics we’ll dive into in the first month, then we’ll choose the topics
after that together.

## Our weekly calls will start on …

🗓️ **Wednesday, Jan 31**

You can join via 🧑‍💻 **Zoom** or by coming over to 🛋️ **our living room** in Baghdad,
where I'll be serving you my favorite tea and Mina her homemade cake.

## Membership

It is our goal to make this club as accessible as possible while also covering
expenses. So we have made the following “small, medium and large” price tiers
available per 2-hour session. Regardless of which price tier you choose, you get the
same experience:

* 🛹 S: $10 if it’s a stretch for you to be investing in this club at the moment,
  please choose this tier.
* 🚲 M: $16 if you are financially stable and don’t have to think too much about
  whether you can afford this club, please choose this tier.
* 🏎️ L: $22 if you are financially flourishing, you have the opportunity to
  contribute to our scholarship fund and enable people with fewer resources to also
  participate.

**Scholarships** are available for those who need them. Your participation matters
most to us, not the price.

{{<callout>}}
We ask all new members to start out with a 2-month membership period to give enough
time for evaluating their club membership. After that, renewals can be done on a
monthly basis.
{{</callout>}}

**To keep our meetings valuable, we limit the number of members to no more than 7.**
{{</callout>}}

## Financial Transparency

Income from membership sales will be used to cover online tools and subscription
expenses. The organizing team is donating their time, so we’ll also use membership
income to cover their expenses. Any surplus that is left at the end of the month will
go towards The Journey (الرحلة) fund, building a pool of funds to develop the network
and organize future activities like this one, the 29 day challenge, the gap year,
etc.
