I called my friend Mustafa Alwan, founder of [Kawanter](https://kawenter.com), to ask
him how he built his mobile app—an app used by hundreds of thousands of travelers. He
told me that he uses [FlutterFlow.io](https://flutterflow.io).

Even more, Mustafa taught his friend to use FlutterFlow, who then rebuilt their
company's entire app and saved the company $60k in dev costs.

I got into this call with Mustafa in the first place because as I was driving back
from Baghdad airport, I thought wouldn't it be great if I could pick a traveler up
with me and share the costs? I want to build a functional proof of concept carpooling
app, like the widely adopted BlaBlaCar in Europe, in a day or two. That got me to
think of Mustafa immediately because he's the guy who builds apps like that in crazy
short time and onboards thousands of customers in a matter of weeks. I want to learn
from him.

### Agenda

We'll be punctual by starting on time, but after that we'll decide how to use the
time based on what feels right. Therefore, make sure you arrive on time and keep your
expectations flexible with the duration of each component of the agenda.

- **45mins: Mujtaba interviews Mustafa**

  Mustafa will share his screen and show us how he uses tools, such as Airtable and
  FlutterFlow, in building mobile apps and websites used by hundreds of thousands of
  people.

  This will be an interactive session and the participants will get to raise questions to Mustafa directly.
- **10mins: Break**
- **45mins: Interview continues**
- **45mins: Lunch**

  This will be a great opportunity to digest the new learnings (pun intended), by discussing them with other participants over a meal.
- **2hrs: Hands-on Workshop**

  To solidify what we learned, we all will open our laptops and work on building apps using the new tools.
