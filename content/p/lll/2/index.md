At the start of the meeting, Ali Swaidan shared his reflection on Bloom's Taxonomy
and how helpful it would've been for him had he known about it when he was a
university student to know that learning goes beyond just memorization.

As we got into our topic of the week, Mohammed shared with us that 10,000 hours are
not enough to be an expert, we also need:

1. **Repeated attempts with feedback**

   Maryam reflected on this by recalling how in school, feedback comes from exams,
   which are too late, hindering the students' learning. As a remedy to that, Maryam,
   as well as Mina, got into study groups, much like the LLLC, which provided an
   environment for more immediate feedback.

   We also talked about chunking, Mina shared that it is similar to grouping in 3D
   Software, which makes the software perform faster when individual objects are
   grouped together. Mujtaba shared the example of riding a bicycle and memorizing
   digit strings, and Marie shared the example of teaching children to read numbers
   by breaking up the lines forming the symbols into individual parts.
2. **Valid environment**
    We went over the same examples that were mentioned in the video and examined
    them.
3. **Timely feedback**
   Raheem added that receiving timely feedback is motivating. Maryam shared her
   experience of applying for a scholarship and getting rejected without receiving
   feedback explaining what she missed so she can improve her application in a future
   attempt.
4. **Deliberate practice**
   Mina & Raheem shared the story of driving on the opposite side in Malaysia and
   Indonesia and how that required extra concentration compared to regular driving
   and was uncomfortable, which made it improve the skill of driving.

   Ali Swaidan questioned whether the idea of exiting the comfort zone is a Western
   construct and doesn't work in the East. He also wondered what's the point of
   leaving the comfort zone if it's unpleasant? In response, Mina shared how her
   father has spent his life settling in his comfort zone, but when it comes to his
   work, he goes out of his comfort zone, which has made him an expert in his field.
   Mina also shared how she's stepping out of her comfort zone by teaching ceramics,
   which has made her a better ceramist. Ali Swaidan then explained that we don't
   always have to strive for growth; i.e. if we want to grow, we should step out of
   our comfort zone, and if we don't want to go, it's OK to enjoy being in our
   comfort zone. Finally, we examined Mihaly's Flow state to gain a better
   understanding of how far out of the comfort zone to go.

After reflecting on the video, we shared some questions and finally we ended with the
takeaways that each of us was leaving with. The one common takeaway we all shared
was **we'd all re-watch the video** and observe what it's like to watch it with a
renewed understanding.
