We started with everybody introducing themselves by sharing how they felt (with the
aid of NVC's needs & feelings inventory¹) and their intention for their journey in
the club. We each wrote and shared our intentions. Then we outlined our 5 values, and
broke them down with examples. Finally, we looked at how we learn by examining the
levels of Bloom's Taxonomy², the learning technique of Richard Feynman⁴, and note
taking using Mind Maps⁵. We closed our meeting by watching a video about The Learning
Pit⁶.
