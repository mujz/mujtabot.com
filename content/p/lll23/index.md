Are you eager to be part of a vibrant community of lifelong learners who gather weekly to explore topics spanning philosophy, psychology, art, science, technology, and everything in between?

I thrive on knowledge and discovery through various means:

- **Podcasts**: Currently I’m engrossed in [Hidden Brain](https://hiddenbrain.org/).
- **Reading**: I’m currently immersed in 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World by Elif Shafak. Let’s connect on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35399941-mujtaba-al-tameemi).
- **YouTube**: I'm captivated by creators like [Van Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT6wYbaRrlQ).
- **Meditation**: Exploring wisdom like [the parable of the second arrow](https://grandrapidstherapygroup.com/second-arrow-of-suffering/) with [DownDog](https://www.downdogapp.com).
- **Traveling the world**: My recent favorite city is Orgiva, Spain.
- **Engaging Conversations:** Spending time with thoughtful people, like you 😉

These are just a few sources that continually enrich my life with knowledge and experience. To transform this into a boundless well of insight, I engage with people, exchanging ideas and perspectives.

Recently, my beautiful friend Maytham and I had an inspiring video call where we watched a [podcast on becoming emotionally agile with Dr. Susan David, Dr. Rick Hanson, and his son Forrest Hanson](https://www.rickhanson.net/being-well-podcast-becoming-emotionally-agile-with-dr-susan-david/). At the end of our call, Maytham and I unearthed feelings that had long been tucked away in our hearts. This made us vow to having more of these conversations.

I'm sharing this with you today to kickstart the journey of fulfilling this vow.

## I invite you to …

Join Maytham and me, alongside other wonderful people I’m honored to call friends and family, to have weekly calls starting Wednesday, Oct 25. We'll delve into each topic linked to below and engage in a thoughtful discussion. During our conversations, each of us will share what the learning meant to them.

## Some agreements before we start

- 🧑‍💻 **Preparation:** Everyone participating in the call should have engaged with the topic of the week.
- 🫶 **Compassionate conversations:** Our discussions will be filled with compassion, not judgment. We want everyone to feel free to be as [vulnerable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o) as they'd like without fear of external influences from the group.
- 🌐 **Language:** Our conversations will be a blend of English and Arabic. You don't need to be fluent in both languages, but the ability to read/listen in both is preferred.

## Topics

[Topics](https://mujz.notion.site/233dfdd4bd9447d38041d8db8917264d?v=73ad46982bdf4b4c899eb2345e0bb843)

These are the topics we’ll delve into in the first month, then we’ll choose the topics after that together. For more details on a topic, click on its title in the table above.

## Our weekly calls will start on …

🗓️ **Wednesday, Oct 25**

🧑‍💻 on Zoom or Google Meet

The inaugural topic will be from [‎WorkLife with Adam Grant: The Science of Recharging on Weekends and Vacations](https://podcasts.apple.com/tr/podcast/worklife-with-adam-grant/id1346314086?i=1000629096574).

We’ll have weekly calls thereafter.

## Membership

It is our goal to make this club as accessible as possible while also covering expenses. So we have made the following “small, medium and large” weekly price tiers available:

* 🛹 S: $8 if it’s a stretch for you to be investing in this club at the moment, please choose this tier.
* 🚲 M: $12 if you are financially stable and don’t have to think too much about whether you can afford this club, please choose this tier.
* 🏎️ L: $20 if you are financially flourishing, you have the opportunity to contribute to our scholarship fund and enable people with fewer resources to also participate.

**Scholarships** are available for those who need them. Your participation matters most to us, not the price.

## Financial Transparency

Income from membership sales will be used to cover online tools and subscriptions expenses. The organizing team is donating their time, so we’ll also use membership income to cover their expenses. Any surplus that is left at the end of the month will go towards The Journey (الرحلة) fund, building a pool of funds to develop the network and organize future activities like this one, the 29 day challenge, the gap year, etc.
