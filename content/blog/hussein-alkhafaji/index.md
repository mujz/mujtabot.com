> اني احس كل الناس يحبوني، لانه اني احب كل الناس
>
> I feel loved by everyone, because I love everyone

— Hussein Al-Khafaji

I was a 13-year-old kid in 8th grade. He taught older kids physics in 11th and 12 grade, but he came to our classroom to fill in for an absent teacher.

He radiated kindness and love that I hadn’t seen before. His words and presence remain etched in my mind with pristine clarity, even after all these years. He opened my heart and planted a seed inside that has continued to grow, even 20 years later. And just like every good seed, its purpose extends beyond mere self-growth, to nourishing those who consume its fruits, pleasing the eyes of onlookers, and spreading the beauty far and wide.

As he taught us about the topic of resonance in Physics, he captured my undivided attention. Every part of me felt the presence of a teacher it wanted to learn from. He did not only know the technical concepts he was teaching, but he had figured out how to lead a meaningful and pleasant life. Unlike other teachers who struggled to get me to listen, he did not have to ask for my attentiveness or respect, I gave it all to him and still felt like it was not enough.

Now I say this to myself and ask you to be my witness:

> Be like teacher Hussein Al-Khafaji. Love everyone, radiate kindness, and inspire people to open their hearts and lead more pleasant lives.
