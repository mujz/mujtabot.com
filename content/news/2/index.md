Since this week was my first in Baghdad, the main theme is around settling in and getting a new home established.

## Updates

### @Community

- We started writing a playbook for our beloved organization, Journey. We don‚Äôt have much to show for it yet, but this is a foundational element that will unlock lots of cool projects to come. I‚Äôm so excited for what will come out of this!
- We had our second call on [The Spirited Man](https://mujz.notion.site/The-Spirited-Man-41da3435b6914a22958f7b5848926306?pvs=74) at the [Learners Club](/p/lll). On the squiggly path we traversed in our meeting, we encountered big topics, such as self-confidence, hobbies, turning passion into a well-paying job, [KK‚Äôs 1000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/), Ikigai, quick-fix culture vs sustainable culture, and much more.

    - We surmised that success, subjective as it is, might be composed of 4 contributors: luck, consistent work, effectiveness, and growth mindset. The first is completely out of our control, and the rest are areas that we can learn and grow in.

        I‚Äôm sure that there‚Äôs other elements as well, such as feedback and health, but I think most of these should be components of the four.

### @Home

- After an intense search of a new home in Baghdad, we finally found one! We have a huge rooftop that we plan to turn into a workshop and a place to host people. We can‚Äôt wait to have you over!
- Mina announced a new series of pottery classes, and now you can choose to work on a pottery wheel (my personal favorite). [Sign up here](https://hamdiya.co/en/workshops) if you‚Äôd like. Seats are filling rapidly üî•.

- We received all the boxes we sent from Istanbul, including our folding electric bike! It‚Äôs been so nice riding it around Baghdad. In one day, I rode 33km and it took only 1 hour and a half.

    ![In the absence of a proper face mask that keeps out car exhaust and other pollutants, I used this beautiful shemagh. Also, I‚Äôm still featuring the Super Iraqis sticker on my helmet :D](4.jpg)

### @Me

- The plot thickens in *[10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43706466-10-minutes-38-seconds-in-this-strange-world)***.** The characters of the story are now mature and starting to do things. It seems like they‚Äôre about to get themselves in deep trouble, and I‚Äôm worried for them XD.
- I created a financial tracking system for my finances using Airtable. Watch the video if you‚Äôd like to see what it looks like.

    {{<vimeo "Finance Tracking System on Airtable" "https://player.vimeo.com/video/883875804?h=c3ab90561f&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479">}}

    If you‚Äôd like to set up a system like it for yourself, I‚Äôd like to help you out in exchange for feedback. [Reach out to me](https://t.me/mujzuh).

- After reading [this post on micromanagement](https://www.breathehr.com/en-gb/blog/topic/health-and-wellbeing/8-signs-youre-dealing-with-a-micro-manager-and-how-to-manage-them), I learned, regrettably, that I‚Äôve been guilty of subjecting people I work with to micromanagement. Some of the most glaring signs that point to it include:
    - Long standups. I ask about nitty gritty details making the meetings I join extra long.
    - Overcomplicating tasks. I have a clear vision in my head for high quality work, but it comes out quite complex when I communicate it.
    - Requiring my sign off for approval. Too often I block my coworkers from moving forward without my review.

    All this I‚Äôm sure played a big role in stifling the enthusiasm and energy of the people I work with, and for this, I‚Äôm deeply regretful. If you‚Äôre one of the people I‚Äôve done this to, I‚Äôm sorry. Please [tell me](https://t.me/mujzuh) what I can do to redeem these mistakes of the past.

    Friends, have you caught any other behavior in me that I could work on? I could really use your help seeing my blind spots. [Shoot me a message](https://t.me/mujzuh) please.


## Quotes

> In everyday life, it‚Äôs better to be valued than needed.
Being needed creates dependency in others and obligation for you. You feel worried and guilty about letting them down.
Being valued grants autonomy. Your help is appreciated but not expected on their road to self-reliance.

## Help Needed

Now that we have a home, we could use help setting it up.

- If you know someone getting rid of stuff and furniture, whether for free or for money, please hook us up. We love giving unwanted or dying objects a new life.
- If you enjoy working on setting up a home with close friends, please lend us a hand as we clean the new place and transport the furniture.

That‚Äôs all for now. Please [share with me](https://t.me/mujzuh) your feelings and thoughts on this week‚Äôs issue.

Wrapping this letter with lots of earnest love üíå
