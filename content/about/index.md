## SHORT VERSION

I'm a Software Engineer by practice and an empathy and compassion evangelist by
heart. My most notable work experience is serving as a CTO at
[Bloom](https://bloom.pm), a Lead Software Engineer at
[Thinkific](https://thinkific.com), and a Lead Trainer of Software Development at
[Re:Coded](https://re-coded.com).

In the world of volunteering, I've been working with my brother, Murtadha, on
projects such as
[29 Day Challenge](https://doc.clickup.com/9009115670/p/h/8cfrcgp-1600/44e87fbe76ebf7f),
[Clean Iraq (ÿ≥ŸÅÿ±ÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ∏ÿßŸÅÿ©)](https://www.instagram.com/clean.iraq/),
and [Startup Weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK45HqhZs4Q) to name a few.

If you'd like to do stuff together, I'm always happy working with passionate and
skilled people on projects relating to **education**, **tech**, **community
building**, and **event facilitation**. Or you can join me in one of my
[active projects]({{<relref "/p">}}).

## LONG-WINDED VERSION

Welcome!

My name is Mujtaba. People tell me that I am a weird person. I guess that's what
results from the amalgamation of the Iraqi, Turkish and North American cultures I've
lived in, the crazy wars I've survived, the surreal people living inside me, the
values and beliefs that uplift me, and the actions I take.

### What Drives Me

I believe that I was put on this earth to help reduce human suffering (yup, that's
why people call me weird). I'm not alone in this. Call me crazy, but I like to follow
in the footsteps of the prophet Mohammed, Jesus, The Buddha, et al.

Daniel Kahnemen, the psychologist and author of the infamous book "_Thinking, Fast
and Slow_" said [in a podcast](https://link.chtbl.com/6WRdstfN):

> I think that there is a task for society to reduce misery, not to increase
> happiness.
>
> When you think of reducing misery, you would be led into very different policy
> directions. You would be led into mental health issues. You would be led into a lot
> of other problems. So reducing misery would be my focus.

As for me, my focus is on
[**intentional living**](https://www.google.com/search?q=intentional+living&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
(living by our values)
and **meaningful relationships** (empathy, compassion, trust, feeling heard, no
judgment, etc.).

>}}

In addition to the above, I've noticed that I'm usually most alive when I'm engrossed
in activities that put me in a state of flow, such as:

1. **Coding**: I love hunkering down and writing scripts that solve specific problems
   for people (or just for me).
1. **Writing**: Most of my writings have been private, but recently I've started
   publishing online.
   [Subscribe to my newsletter](https://airtable.com/apptapASF9UQ2IDqq/shr51n9L5n9zom9LN)
   if you'd like to receive my publications.
1. **Teaching**:
    * Computer Science
    * Life skills: Such as Critical Thinking and Active Listening
1. **Sports**:
    * üèä Swimming: My claim to fame is swimming 2km (super amateur compared to beasts
      like Nyad).
    * üö¥ Bike riding: My favorite ride was with my brother Murtadha and our good
      friend Saif from Turkey to Baghdad.
    * üßò Yoga
    * üèîÔ∏è Hiking
    * üèïÔ∏è Camping
    * ü•è Ultimate Frisbee
    * ‚õπÔ∏è Basketball
    * üèì Ping Pong
    * üè∏ Badminton
    * ‚öΩÔ∏è Football
1. **Reading**: Check out my library on
   [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35399941-mujtaba-al-tameemi).
1. **Music**: If I go for more than a few days without listening to music, I'd die (I
   exaggerate).
1. **Hosting people**: If you're in Baghdad and we haven't hosted you yet,
   [text me](https://t.me/mujzuh)!
