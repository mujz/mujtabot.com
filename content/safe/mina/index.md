> Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
> Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
> Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
> And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;<br>
> Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
> And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;<br>
> And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
> By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;<br>
> But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
> Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;<br>
> Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,<br>
> When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:<br>
> {{<indent>}}So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
> {{<indent>}}So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br>

I've read and heard this infamous classic poem by Shakespeare many times, but it
never meant anything to me. Today, it came to me and I was like "ooooh".

In this Sonnet, Shakespeare attempts to compare his lover to a summer's day which is
a symbol of beauty and contentment, but compared to Shakespeare's lover, she is more
beautiful and more constant ("temperate"). Because even in the summer, strong winds
can disturb or damage the flower buds. And the summer, as we know, is fleeting and is
too quick to fade.

In contrast to the fleeting nature of seasonal summers, the beauty of his lover will
never fade. Even death cannot claim victory over her beauty or overshadow it, because
in these "eternal lines" of the poem it will continue to live. As long as there are
people alive to read or see this poem, his lover's beauty will be alive.

As I read the first lines, I thought this is a sweet poem of somebody trying to
express how much they appreciate their partner, but then by the end, I realized it's
much more than that. It's a declaration to the world to immortalize his love for
another person. To say "I love you, and my love for you will continue and grow,
living in the hearts and minds of my readers even after we're both gone, till the end
of time."

Recently we had a major falling out, which led to our separation. This made me doubt
our relationship and start to think maybe this is when it'll end. Maybe we're not
going to have an eternal life-long marriage. Within mere few hours though, I realized
that what we have is much stronger.

For years, we weathered storms that kept us away from each other. We've done what
everyone I tell our story thinks is impossible. What's more is we didn't just wait
idly, but we fought. We stuck together during the hardest of times, and we celebrated
our victory at the most beautiful of weddings.

Since then we've had the usual ups and downs, with one major collapse of the
relationship, which we learned from and got back on our feet pretty quickly, coming
back better than ever. I consider our recent strife to be the second major challenge
our marriage has been faced with.

If you're wondering why I'm saying all this now, it's because this time I've had away
from you has been making me fall deeper and deeper in love with you. I woke up this
morning with the difficult feeling of not having the words to tell you how I love
you. Shakespeare's words captured what's inside of me with such accuracy. If I had
his skill, I would have written this poem about you.

Manno you are my eternal love. I love you and I want the whole world to know it. When
I read this poem, I feel as if I am saying this to you.

Before I end this letter, may I ask you to re-read the poem, but this time reading it
as if it was me saying these words to you?

I love you Mannoti.
