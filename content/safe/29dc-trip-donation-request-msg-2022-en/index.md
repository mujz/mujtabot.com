Hi `__BLANK__:name:Name`,

<p></p>

This message I am writing to you right now is very dear to my heart. I'm sending it to a very small group of people who are really special to me – people I share some of my most cherished memories with from our 29 day challenge trip in Turkey back in 2022.

<p></p>

I still remember clearly when Abubakr and I were reviewing applications for the trip. We were supposed to pick 8 people, but no matter how hard we tried, we just could not do it! We kept looking at each other like "how can we possibly choose?" We narrowed it down to 16 people, and we didn't have the heart to reject any of them. That was literally double our budget!

<p></p>

We spent hours just sitting there trying to figure out what we were gonna do. Then we made this crazy decision – let's just invite all 16 of you and somehow figure out the money later. It was terrifying but we had to try.

<p></p>

And somehow, we actually pulled it off! 12 of you made it (a few couldn't come because of a visa rejection and stuff), and every single person who came was precious! The trip wouldn't have been the same without any of you. I'm still so grateful that we found people willing to donate money to cover your `__BLANK__:funding:E.g. Flight and Housing` so you could be there with us.

<p></p>

So here's the thing, we're doing it all over again this year! There's this group of incredible young people, just like `__BLANK__:name2:Name` from three years ago, who deserve this experience just as much you did, but they need some financial help to make it happen.

<p></p>

I'm reaching out to you to see if you'd want to be that person for someone else, the one who makes their trip possible? No pressure at all, but I thought you might want to know there's a chance to pay it forward. This is one of the most meaningful and gratifying ways to spend money.

<p></p>

This trip would not happen if not for the individuals who donate their money so somebody they never met gets to have an experience that could change their life.

<p></p>

Let me know what you think, and either way, I love you ❤️
