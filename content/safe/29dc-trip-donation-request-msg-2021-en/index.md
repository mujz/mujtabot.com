Hi `__BLANK__:name:Name`,

<p></p>

This message I am writing to you right now is very dear to my heart. I'm sending it to a very small group of people who are really special to me – people I share some of my most cherished memories with from our 29 day challenge trip in Turkey back in 2021.

<p></p>

I still remember that feeling at the first moment when we just met at the airport. I can picture it clearly. Murtadha and I were standing waiting for you to come out of the door, and you started coming out one by one with big smiles drawing on both our faces as our eyes met. We all felt it, you being there at that moment was proof that miracles indeed do happen.

<p></p>

By the end of the trip, we were all transformed into different people. Our lives have never been the same since those days. It's incredible how little it takes to change a life.

<p></p>

Every single person who came was precious! The trip wouldn't have been the same without any of you. I'm still so grateful that we found people willing to donate money to cover all the expenses so you could be there with us.

<p></p>

So here's the thing, we're doing it all over again this year! There's this group of incredible young people, just like `__BLANK__:name2:Name` from four years ago, who deserve this experience just as much you did, but they need some financial help to make it happen.

<p></p>

I'm reaching out to you to see if you'd want to be that person for someone else, the one who makes their trip possible? No pressure at all, but I thought you might want to know there's a chance to pay it forward. This is one of the most meaningful and gratifying ways to spend money.

<p></p>

This trip would not happen if not for the individuals who donate their money so somebody they never met gets to have an experience that could change their life.

<p></p>

Let me know what you think, and either way, I love you.
